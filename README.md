# Gooey (Blender)

**Gooey** is basically the **Goo Engine NPR** pipeline and toolkit ported to **Blender 4.5.14 LTS**. Goo Engine was meant for NPR artists, but has been stuck on 4.4 for a WHILE since the team has been absorbed into Blender, and native features will roll out, in the meantime Gooey exists to bridge the gap between upstream and Goo Engine. Please note that Generative AI was used in the merging of 4.5.x and current goo engine as I, as a single dev couldn't have managed to achieve this. **Also note that this project is highly unstable rn and has not been tested on anything other than fedora gnome**.

## Key Features (other than what goo engine and Blender offer ofc)
### 1. Upscaling because my pc is bad
- **FSR 1 Spatial Upscaling (`CMP_NODE_FSR1`)**:
  - Dual-pass GLSL compute execution featuring **EASU** (Edge-Adaptive Spatial Upsampling) and **RCAS** (Robust Contrast-Adaptive Sharpening).
  - Pass isolation options: `Full (EASU -> RCAS)`, `EASU Only`, `RCAS Only`.
  - NPR detail preservation with an input `Mask` socket modulating sharpening attenuation along cel outlines.
- **LFGA - Linear Film Grain Applicator (`CMP_NODE_LFGA`)**:
  - Linear scene-space procedural film grain evaluated prior to view/display transforms.
  - Perceptual luminance weighting concentrated in midtones, keeping pure blacks and peak highlights clean.
- **TEPD - Temporal Energy Preserving Dither (`CMP_NODE_TEPD`)**:
  - High-precision anti-banding quantization dither using low-discrepancy Weyl sequence temporal phase shifts.
  - Triangular probability distribution function (TPDF) kernel ensuring zero integrated DC energy drift.
- **AMD FSR 3.1.5 & Live Telemetry HUD**:
  - Full Render and Output panel exposure with Quality Mode presets, sharpness slider, and real-time upscaling telemetry (resolution, ratio, frametime, reconstructed frames).
- **Upstream 5.3 Geometry & Scatter Backports**:
  - Multi-threaded surface point distribution and mesh sampling optimizations (up to 6.4x faster scatter on dense geometry).
- **Native Viewport FSR 3.1 Temporal Pipeline**:
  - Temporal integration leveraging Viewport/Render Depth and Motion Vector passes via Vulkan/ffx_api_vk bridge for interactive 3D Viewport playback and final animation rendering.

### 2. Cool looking UI
- **Theme Overhaul (idk, looked cool)**: Polished interface themes featuring flat inactive workspace tabs, soft rounded active pills, and seamless header integration.

### 3. Audio overhaul because audio features are buns rn (using steam audio) - STAGED
